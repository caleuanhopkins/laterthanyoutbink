#Rules for Contributing
---

**How to contribute**
Later Than You Think is a collection of short stories featuring unique characters, all set within a fictional world based on a post apocalyptic earth. You can write your character's story by yourself or with others. However, if you create a character, you own that character. You cannot write about a character unless either you created them or you have permission from the creator of the character to do so.

To start your story, you will need to fork this repo. Then create a new directory and title it by your character's name. You can then create sub directories to indicate the different stories, and sub directories of those directories for chapters etc.

Once you are ready to submit your story (no matter how long it is), submit a pull request into this repo, at which the registered contributors at the time of the PR will review the story and will decide through a democratic voting, if your story is to be accepted as it is. If the story is rejected, reasons will be given why as well as advice on where it needs to be changed or improved to be accepted.

**How to submit a rule change/add new rule**
If you would like to request a rule change or suggest a new rule, please create a new issue in the Github repo and tag it "new rule" or "rule change". If it's a rule change, please clearly state why you think it should change. *DO NOT:* Do not go a head and write a new rule in your story without checking with the contributors. We will be discussing a huge amount of new rules at the start, but we need to ensure the rules fit with all stories, past, present and future. For example, if gravity is to change, we need to discuss why it's changing, how it's changing and what impact this has on the fictional world.

**How to submit or edit a major event and it's details**
To submit a new event, open up a new issue on the GitHub repo and tag it under "event - new". To discuss a change for an event, open up a new issue on the GitHub repo and tag it under "event - edit"
