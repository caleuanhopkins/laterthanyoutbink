# Later Than You Think
---
## Welcome to an open world, open source post apocalypse world where you help create and decide the future for all those living in it.

### We are actively looking for people to contribute to this project! If you're interested in doing so, please check out the contribute.md file in this repo

Society as we know has collapsed. Now there are only survivors avoiding falling into the same state as the "turned"; a group of humans who have been infected with a "super rabies" virus that makes them only think of one thing: spreading the virus. There is other dangers out there too and if the survive or perish, it is up to you!

Create your character(s), write their story and help shape the world they are fighting to survive in. Interact with major timeline events that can effect the world and it's environment, co-operate with other contributors and their characters and either help build a better or doom the remaining survives to their fate. The choice is yours!
