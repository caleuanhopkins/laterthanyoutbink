#World Rules

** Here you will find a set of rules and laws in which dictates how the world in Later Than You Think works. These rules include what the fictional world is like and how your character can interact with it. You must follow these rules, otherwise your contributions will be rejected. If you would like to debate or introduce a rule, please create a new issue in the Github repo and tag it "new rule" or "rule change". If it's a rule change, please clearly state why you think it should change. **

##List of Rules

**Planet Rules**
- The planet is exactly like earth. You can use real locations on earth, such as cities, continents and oceanic paths.
- You can suggest changes to the planet through war, erosion of time or natural changing. However, this must be agreed upon by all the contributions (at the time the change is suggested) to ensure continuity throughout all the stories. For example, we can't have a character who has already in a story travelled through a town which, according to another, is suppose to have disappeared due to waring.
- Gravity is still 9.80665 m / s^2
- Weather patterns may have changed due to rapid decrease in CO2 emissions and possible use of nuclear weapons for defensive purposes **<!- this can be debated -!>**
- There is no power grid unless recovered by characters. Portable generators do exist. There are no currently working petroleum systems due to shutdown emergency procedures. 


***Apocalypse Rules**
- Human races has been infected with a "super rabies" virus. The virus works just like rabies in animals. This means, people become "possessed" upon contraction of the virus and see to attack all other animals to spread the virus. There was a cure, but not enough was produced quick enough, but more could be produced. A large amount of the population was infected, however, and has died off. There are still some rabies infected humans roaming around. For more information on rabies, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies) and [http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rabies/Pages/Introduction.aspx](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rabies/Pages/Introduction.aspx).
- Guns can be available, depending on the character location. For example, in the US they are probably just lying around everywhere, where as in the UK, they will be rare in towns and medium sized cities. They may be more common in heavy dense cities and rural country sides.
- Towns with barricades may be built and may already in existence.
- No long range communications, only short wave through walkie talkies. Therefore, no one has a big picture of what's going on.
- All governments have collapsed. 
- There may be some military personnel existing, but no large battalions or armies... yet ...
- Infected do not have rotten flesh, they can run, they have slightly stronger strength than normal humans but will get weaker the longer they are infected due to lack of eating and resting thanks to the virus. They have to have their head separated from the body to die or have the brain destroyed if still attached to their body.

**Timeline Rules**
- The apocalypse happened on April 1st 2015. On this day, infected humans began to become uncontrollable in terms of their numbers and started to break out of hospital quarantines. A&E departments become over run with patients "turning" and started to attack other patients. Governments collapsed after declaring states of emergencies. Stories can take place before, during and after this date but must keep this date as a reference.
- Work with other contributors to ensure major events are reflected across all stories. For example, if a huge explosion happens in a city on 11th July 2020, if your character is active on this date and is near the area in which the explosion is said to have happened, reference the event in your story.

**Science Rukes**
- All scientific discoveries up till the 1st April 2015 in the real world can be used and referenced in the stories. If there has been a discovery before the 1st April 2016 but we don't hear about about in the real world until a date after then, it can still be used in stories but must be uncovered by characters, rather than being common knowledge between them (uncovered as in find machinery, papers and.or research materials whilst exploring).
