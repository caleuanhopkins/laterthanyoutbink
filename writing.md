# Writing Guide

There is not a struct rules to writing. We are pretty much open for all styles and for any writing experience to get involved. We are seeking contributors who have writing experience to help form a core team of reviewers, but we will be accepting work from those who have never written before too.

To try and create some connection between everyone's writing styles, we have put together a small list of tips to keep in mind when writing your story:

- Plan out your story/chapters. Make sure there's a clear journey happening to the characters, whether that actually involves travelling or it's more metaphorical.
- Make sure you would enjoying reading your story if you were not writing it yourself. If you enjoy reading it back to yourself, chances are someone will enjoy reading it.
- "Introduce your main characters and themes in the first third of your novel. If you are writing a plot-driven genre novel make sure all your major themes/plot elements are introduced in the first third, which you can call the introduction. Develop your themes and characters in your second third, the development. Resolve your themes, mysteries and so on in the final third, the resolution." — Michael Moorcock
- "Read it aloud to yourself because that's the only way to be sure the rhythms of the sentences are OK (prose rhythms are too complex and subtle to be thought out—they can be got right only by ear)." — Diana Athill
- "The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you're allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it's definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter." — Neil Gaiman
